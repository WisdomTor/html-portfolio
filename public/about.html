<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Wisdom Tor — a junior developer with a growing passion for building and learning in the world of technology. I’m currently focused on strengthening my skills in web development, coding best practices, and problem-solving.</p>

<p>I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional solutions and I see every project as an opportunity to grow, experiment, and create something meaningful. My long-term goal is to build applications that not only solve problems but also make people’s lives easier.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I love exploring new ideas, learning about emerging tech, and challenging myself with creative projects. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far — and I’m excited to keep improving and sharing my progress.</p>
